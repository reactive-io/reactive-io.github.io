<h2 id="Using-the-issue-tracker"><a href="#Using-the-issue-tracker" class="headerlink" title="Using the issue tracker"></a>Using the issue tracker</h2><p>The issue tracker is for:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#bug-reports">Bug Reports</a></li>
<li><a href="#feature-requests">Feature Requests</a></li>
<li><a href="#pull-requests">Submitting Pull Requests</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Please <strong>do not</strong> use the issue tracker for personal support requests.</p>
<h2 id="Bug-Reports"><a href="#Bug-Reports" class="headerlink" title="Bug Reports"></a>Bug Reports</h2><p>A bug is a <em>demonstrable problem</em> that is caused by the code in the repository.</p>
<p>Guidelines for bug reports:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Use the GitHub issue search</strong> &mdash; check if the issue has already been<br>reported.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Check if the issue has been fixed</strong> &mdash; try to reproduce it using the<br><code>master</code> branch in the repository.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Isolate and report the problem</strong> &mdash; ideally create a reduced test<br>case or a small <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/">jsfiddle</a> showing the issue.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include information about<br>your operating system, browser, jQuery version, and masked input plugin version.<br>Please provide steps to reproduce the issue as well as the outcome you were expecting.</p>
<h2 id="Feature-Requests"><a href="#Feature-Requests" class="headerlink" title="Feature Requests"></a>Feature Requests</h2><p>Feature requests are welcome. It’s up to <em>you</em> to make a strong case of the merits of<br>this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.</p>
<p>Features that have a very narrow use case are unlikely to be accepted unless we<br>can come up with a way to come to a more general solution. Please don’t let<br>that stop you from sharing your ideas, just keep that in mind.</p>
<h2 id="Pull-Requests"><a href="#Pull-Requests" class="headerlink" title="Pull Requests"></a>Pull Requests</h2><p>Good pull requests are very helpful. They should remain focused<br>in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: By submitting a patch, you agree that your work will be<br>licensed under the license used by the project.</p>
<p>If you have any large pull request in mind (e.g. implementing features,<br>refactoring code, etc), <strong>please ask first</strong> otherwise you risk spending<br>a lot of time working on something that the project’s developers might<br>not want to merge into the project.</p>
<p>Please adhere to the coding conventions in the project (indentation,<br>accurate comments, etc.) and don’t forget to add your own tests and<br>documentation. When working with git, we recommend the following process<br>in order to craft an excellent pull request:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><a href="http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/">Fork</a> the project, clone your fork,<br>and configure the remotes:</p>
<pre><code class="bash"># Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
git clone https://github.com/&lt;your-username&gt;/jquery.maskedinput
# Navigate to the newly cloned directory
cd jquery.maskedinput
# Assign the original repo to a remote called &quot;upstream&quot;
git remote add upstream https://github.com/digitalBush/jquery.maskedinput
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git pull upstream master
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Create a new topic branch (off of <code>master</code>) to contain your feature, change,<br>or fix.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Making changes in <code>master</code> is discouraged. You should always<br>keep your local <code>master</code> in sync with upstream <code>master</code> and make your<br>changes in topic branches.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout -b &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Commit your changes in logical chunks. Keep your commit messages organized,<br>with a short description in the first line and more detailed information on<br>the following lines.</p>
<p>Please use git’s<br><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase">interactive rebase</a><br>feature to tidy up your commits before making them public. Ideally when you<br>are finished you’ll have a single commit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Make sure all the tests are still passing.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">npm test
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p>Push your topic branch up to your fork:</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git push origin &lt;topic-branch-name&gt;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li><p><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/">Open a Pull Request</a><br> with a clear title and description.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If you haven’t updated your pull request for a while, you should consider<br>rebasing on master and resolving any conflicts.</p>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: <em>Never ever</em> merge upstream <code>master</code> into your branches. You<br>should always <code>git rebase</code> on <code>master</code> to bring your changes up to date when<br>necessary.</p>
<pre><code class="bash">git checkout master
git pull upstream master
git checkout &lt;your-topic-branch&gt;
git rebase master
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
